# Nogad Engine
Nogad Engine (likely to be renamed whenever I can think of something
better) is a 3D C++ game engine using Windows' DirectX11 graphics API.

## Download
You can download the latest release [here](https://github.com/UltraDagon/GraphicsEngine/raw/refs/heads/master/x64/Release/GraphicsEngine.exe),
though it will likely just be a snippit of whatever feature I am currently working on.
